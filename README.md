# Autosave Notes
A note-taking web application built with the MERN stack that features an autosave capability. Users can create and manage notes with rich text processing capabilities, thanks to the integration of the Quill library. Notes are automatically saved to a MongoDB database, preserving changes even if the user navigates away from the page. Each note has a unique URL that can be shared with others.
